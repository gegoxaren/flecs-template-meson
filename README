FLECS Meson Template.

This project is agnostic over what version controll system you are using.

All source (Header and C) files should be sholud be put in the directory 'src',
and the file 'src/meson.build' should be changed to have those files included.

To start off open a terminal in the templates base-diretory (the direcory where
this file resides), then do as follows:

  $ mkdir build
  $ cd build
  $ meson ..
  $ ninja

This will download the required resoures, and compile a sanity-check.
